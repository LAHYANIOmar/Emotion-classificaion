# Facial recognition and facial expression classification.
acial recognition and emotion detection are two important aspects of computer
vision and data science. With the advancements in deep learning and artificial
intelligence, the ability to automatically recognize faces and accurately infer emotions
from facial expressions has become increasingly feasible and valuable. This report
focuses on the development and evaluation of models for facial recognition and facial
expression classification.
The primary objective of this project is to build or find suitable datasets for both facial
recognition and facial expression classification. These two datasets may not be the
same, as they serve different purposes. The facial recognition dataset aims to capture
and represent the unique features and characteristics of individuals’ faces, enabling the
identification and verification of individuals. On the other hand, the facial expression
classification dataset focuses on capturing various facial expressions associated with
different emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.
The models developed in this project will leverage state-of-the-art techniques in deep
learning and computer vision. For facial recognition, convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) are commonly used due to their ability to extract and learn intricate facial
features. The models for facial expression classification will also utilize deep learning
techniques, enabling accurate emotion inference based on facial expressions.
By accurately recognizing faces and detecting emotions, the potential applications are
diverse and impactful. In the domain of security, facial recognition can be employed
for access control, surveillance, and law enforcement purposes. Emotion detection,
on the other hand, can be applied in fields like human-computer interaction, where
systems can adapt and respond to users’ emotional states. Additionally, emotion de-
tection has promising applications in healthcare, psychology, and marketing, where
understanding and analyzing human emotions are of utmost importance.
